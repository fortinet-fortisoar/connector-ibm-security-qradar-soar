## Included playbooks
The `Sample - ibm-security-qradar-soar - 1.0.0` playbook collection comes bundled with the IBM Security QRadar SOAR connector. These playbooks contain steps using which you can perform all supported actions. You can see bundled playbooks in the **Automation** > **Playbooks** section in FortiSOAR&trade; after importing the IBM Security QRadar SOAR connector.

- Close Incident
- Create Incident
- Get Incident Details
- Get Open Incidents
- Search Incidents
- Update Incident

**Note**: If you are planning to use any of the sample playbooks in your environment, ensure that you clone those playbooks and move them to a different collection since the sample playbook collection gets deleted during connector upgrade and delete.
